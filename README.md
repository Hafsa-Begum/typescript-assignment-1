- What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
- What is the use of the keyof keyword in TypeScript? Provide an example.


TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript. It has gained popularity among developers for its highly sophisticated typing system. There are two ways of defining data types, such as interfaces and types. Both interface and type are used to define the structure of objects, but they differ in flexibility and usage. While types are used for variables allowing unions, intersections, and more complex type definitions, interfaces shape syntax for classes, properties, methods, and events. But how do we choose between them? Knowing the subtle differences and use cases is essential for efficient development. Let's deep dive to know that.

## Differences between types and interfaces
While types and interfaces share similarities in some case, there are key differences between them, such as:

- handling primitive types
- union and intersection types
- declaration merging
- function and tuple types

Knowing these differences is essential to select the appropriate data shape for the job and optimize TypeScript development.
